Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder of connective tissue caused by mutations in fibrillin-1 (encoded by FBN1 in humans and Fbn1 in mice), a matrix component of extracellular microfibrils. A distinct subgroup of individuals with Marfan syndrome have distal airspace enlargement, historically described as emphysema, which frequently results in spontaneous lung rupture (pneumothorax; refs. 1-3). To investigate the pathogenesis of genetically imposed emphysema, we analyzed the lung phenotype of mice deficient in fibrillin-1, an accepted model of Marfan syndrome. Lung abnormalities are evident in the immediate postnatal period and manifest as a developmental impairment of distal alveolar septation. Aged mice deficient in fibrillin-1 develop destructive emphysema consistent with the view that early developmental perturbations can predispose to late-onset, seemingly acquired phenotypes. We show that mice deficient in fibrillin-1 have marked dysregulation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) activation and signaling, resulting in apoptosis in the developing lung. Perinatal antagonism of TGF-beta attenuates apoptosis and rescues alveolar septation in vivo. These data indicate that matrix sequestration of cytokines is crucial to their regulated activation and signaling and that perturbation of this function can contribute to the pathogenesis of disease.", "sourceid": "12598898", "denotations": [{"obj": "Disease:D008382", "span": {"begin": 85, "end": 100}}, {"obj": "Disease:D030342", "span": {"begin": 107, "end": 134}}, {"obj": "Disease:D008382", "span": {"begin": 68, "end": 83}}, {"obj": "Disease:D008382", "span": {"begin": 327, "end": 342}}, {"obj": "Disease:D004646", "span": {"begin": 403, "end": 412}}, {"obj": "Disease:D008171", "span": {"begin": 454, "end": 466}}, {"obj": "Disease:D004646", "span": {"begin": 549, "end": 558}}, {"obj": "Disease:D008382", "span": {"begin": 646, "end": 661}}, {"obj": "Disease:D008171", "span": {"begin": 663, "end": 681}}, {"obj": "Disease:D002282", "span": {"begin": 781, "end": 789}}, {"obj": "Disease:D004646", "span": {"begin": 856, "end": 865}}, {"obj": "Disease:D021081", "span": {"begin": 1046, "end": 1059}}, {"obj": "Disease:D002282", "span": {"begin": 1245, "end": 1253}}, {"obj": "Gene:21803", "span": {"begin": 17, "end": 25}}, {"obj": "Gene:2200", "span": {"begin": 179, "end": 190}}, {"obj": "Gene:2200", "span": {"begin": 203, "end": 207}}, {"obj": "Gene:2200", "span": {"begin": 222, "end": 226}}, {"obj": "Gene:14118", "span": {"begin": 612, "end": 623}}, {"obj": "Gene:14118", "span": {"begin": 824, "end": 835}}, {"obj": "Gene:14118", "span": {"begin": 1022, "end": 1033}}, {"obj": "Gene:21803", "span": {"begin": 1096, "end": 1104}}, {"obj": "Gene:21803", "span": {"begin": 1203, "end": 1211}}, {"obj": "Species:9606", "span": {"begin": 211, "end": 217}}, {"obj": "Species:10090", "span": {"begin": 230, "end": 234}}, {"obj": "Species:10090", "span": {"begin": 594, "end": 598}}, {"obj": "Species:10090", "span": {"begin": 806, "end": 810}}, {"obj": "Species:10090", "span": {"begin": 1004, "end": 1008}}], "sourcedb": "PubMed"}{"text": "Are there socio-economic inequalities in age of resection of colorectal cancer in people with HNPCC?

However, there are socio-economic gradients in mortality from colorectal cancer. The socio-economic distribution of incidence of and mortality from colorectal cancer in individuals with hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (Lynch syndrome) is not known. It is possible that increased awareness of and access to screening for colorectal cancer amongst this group of individuals reduces the socio-economic gradients seen in the population as a whole. We investigated the relationship between socio-economic status and age of resection of colorectal cancer in a cohort of individuals with hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this work is to provide updated guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of girls and women with Turner syndrome (TS). PARTICIPANTS: The Turner Syndrome Consensus Study Group is a multidisciplinary panel of experts with relevant clinical and research experience with TS that met in Bethesda, Maryland, April 2006. The meeting was supported by the National Institute of Child Health and unrestricted educational grants from pharmaceutical companies. EVIDENCE: The study group used peer-reviewed published information to form its principal recommendations. Expert opinion was used where good evidence was lacking. CONSENSUS: The study group met for 3 d to discuss key issues. Breakout groups focused on genetic, cardiological, auxological, psychological, gynecological, and general medical concerns and drafted recommendations for presentation to the whole group. Draft reports were available for additional comment on the meeting web site. Synthesis of the section reports and final revisions were reviewed by e-mail and approved by whole-group consensus. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that parents receiving a prenatal diagnosis of TS be advised of the broad phenotypic spectrum and the good quality of life observed in TS in recent years. We recommend that magnetic resonance angiography be used in addition to echocardiography to evaluate the cardiovascular system and suggest that patients with defined cardiovascular defects be cautioned in regard to pregnancy and certain types of exercise. We recommend that puberty should not be delayed to promote statural growth. We suggest a comprehensive educational evaluation in early childhood to identify potential attention-deficit or nonverbal learning disorders. We suggest that caregivers address the prospect of premature ovarian failure in an open and sensitive manner and emphasize the critical importance of estrogen treatment for feminization and for bone health during the adult years. All individuals with TS require continued monitoring of hearing and thyroid function throughout the lifespan. We suggest that adults with TS be monitored for aortic enlargement, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia.", "sourceid": "17047017", "denotations": [{"obj": "Disease:D014424", "span": {"begin": 29, "end": 44}}, {"obj": "Disease:D014424", "span": {"begin": 65, "end": 80}}, {"obj": "Disease:D014424", "span": {"begin": 223, "end": 238}}, {"obj": "Disease:D014424", "span": {"begin": 240, "end": 242}}, {"obj": "Disease:D014424", "span": {"begin": 263, "end": 278}}, {"obj": "Disease:D014424", "span": {"begin": 393, "end": 395}}, {"obj": "Disease:D014424", "span": {"begin": 1252, "end": 1254}}, {"obj": "Disease:D014424", "span": {"begin": 1340, "end": 1342}}, {"obj": "Disease:D002318", "span": {"begin": 1526, "end": 1548}}, {"obj": "Disease:D001289", "span": {"begin": 1783, "end": 1832}}, {"obj": "Disease:D016649", "span": {"begin": 1885, "end": 1910}}, {"obj": "Disease:D014424", "span": {"begin": 2085, "end": 2087}}, {"obj": "Disease:D014424", "span": {"begin": 2202, "end": 2204}}, {"obj": "Disease:D006973", "span": {"begin": 2242, "end": 2254}}, {"obj": "Disease:D003920", "span": {"begin": 2256, "end": 2264}}, {"obj": "Disease:D050171", "span": {"begin": 2270, "end": 2282}}, {"obj": "Chemical:D004967", "span": {"begin": 1984, "end": 1992}}, {"obj": "Species:9606", "span": {"begin": 8, "end": 13}}, {"obj": "Species:9606", "span": {"begin": 18, "end": 23}}, {"obj": "Species:9606", "span": {"begin": 202, "end": 207}}, {"obj": "Species:9606", "span": {"begin": 212, "end": 217}}, {"obj": "Species:9606", "span": {"begin": 245, "end": 257}}, {"obj": "Species:9606", "span": {"begin": 495, "end": 500}}, {"obj": "Species:9606", "span": {"begin": 1504, "end": 1512}}], "sourcedb": "PubMed"}{"text": "Marfan syndrome: clinical diagnosis and management.

Use of a care pathway can help implementation of the nosology in the clinic. The penetrance of some features is age dependent, so the nosology must be used with caution in children. Molecular testing may be helpful in this context. The nosology cannot be used in families with isolated aortic dissection, or with related conditions such as Loeys-Dietz syndrome, although it may help identify families for further diagnostic evaluation because they do not fulfill the nosology, despite a history of aneurysm. Prophylactic medical (eg beta-blockade) and surgical intervention is important in reducing the cardiovascular complications of Marfan syndrome. Musculoskeletal symptoms are common, although the pathophysiology is less clear--for example, the correlation between dural ectasia and back pain is uncertain. Symptoms in other systems require specialist review such as ophthalmology assessment of refractive errors and ectopia lentis. Pregnancy is a time of increased cardiovascular risk for women with Marfan syndrome, particularly if the aortic root exceeds 4 cm at the start of pregnancy.

Noonan syndrome is a relatively common developmental disorder that is characterized by reduced growth, wide-set eyes and congenital heart defects. Noonan syndrome is associated with dysregulation of the Ras-mitogen-activated-protein-kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Recently, two mutations in NRAS were reported to be associated with Noonan syndrome, T50I and G60E. Here, we report a mutation in NRAS, resulting in an I24N amino acid substitution, that we identified in an individual bearing typical Noonan syndrome features. The I24N mutation activates N-Ras, resulting in enhanced downstream signaling. Expression of N-Ras-I24N, N-Ras-G60E or the strongly activating mutant N-Ras-G12V, which we included as a positive control, results in developmental defects in zebrafish embryos, demonstrating that these activating N-Ras mutants are sufficient to induce developmental disorders. The defects in zebrafish embryos are reminiscent of symptoms in individuals with Noonan syndrome and phenocopy the defects that other Noonan-syndrome-associated genes induce in zebrafish embryos. MEK inhibition completely rescued the activated N-Ras-induced phenotypes, demonstrating that these defects are mediated exclusively by Ras-MAPK signaling.

RESULTS: In our database, we identified three cases of Noonan syndrome. The diagnosis was suspected prenatally in two of them. Thirty-nine cases were identified in the literature. In the presented cases we show that suspicion of Noonan syndrome should arise when, after an increased nuchal translucency, ultrasound investigation in the second trimester shows a persistant nuchal fold (NF) or cystic hygroma in combination with at least one of the following features: hydrops fetalis, pleural effusion, cardiac anomalies, polyhydramnios or specific facial abnormalities.

RECENT FINDINGS: In this review, we focus on the impact of the revised MFS clinical diagnostic criteria. We discuss lessons that have been learned from molecular findings in relevant Marfan-related conditions, such as sporadic thoracic aortic aneurysm/dissection, stiff skin syndrome, acromelic dysplasias and Loeys-Dietz syndrome. We explore the latest insights into the role of the alternative TGF-b signaling pathways in MFS pathogenesis. Finally, we give an update on the current and future treatment strategies.

BACKGROUND: Chiari I malformations (CM-I) have been associated with a variety of developmental abnormalities in the literature. A few cases of CM-I in patients with Noonan syndrome (NS) have been reported; however, opinion remains divided as to whether the observed association is coincidental. DISCUSSION: Six previous cases of CM-I in patients with NS have been described in the literature. Many of these had other neurological abnormalities; however, neurological problems are not a prominent part of earlier descriptions of NS. A statistically significant association between NS and CM-I is difficult to obtain at present due to availability and logistical issues with scanning many asymptomatic patients. Although we believe a link exists between CM-I and NS, there is little understanding on how NS may cause CM-I. The most logical cause would be posterior fossa abnormality; however, the most common genetic mutation in NS tends to cause frontal and facial abnormalities, and the posterior fossa tends to be relatively spared. Other genetic mutations may also affect the posterior cranium and thus create the appropriate conditions for a CM-I to develop. ILLUSTRATIVE CASE: We report a case of CM-I in a 9-year-old patient with Noonan syndrome, severe scoliosis and syringomyelia.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We review recent understanding of the pathophysiology, molecular biology, and management of Turner syndrome. RECENT FINDINGS: Sophisticated genetic techniques are able to detect mosaicism in one-third of individuals previously thought to have monosomy X. Prenatal detection using maternal blood should permit noninvasive detection of most fetuses with an X chromosome abnormality. Disproportionate growth with short limbs has been documented in this condition, and a target gene of short stature homeobox, connective tissue growth factor (Ctgf), has been described. Liver disease is more common in Turner syndrome than previously recognized. Most girls have gonadal failure. Spontaneous puberty and menarche is more commonly seen in girls with XX mosaicism. Low-dose estrogen replacement therapy may be given early to induce a more normal onset and tempo of puberty. Oocyte donation for assisted reproduction carries a substantial risk, particularly if the woman has known cardiac or aortic disease. Neurodevelopmental differences in Turner syndrome are beginning to be correlated with differences in brain anatomy.

PURPOSE: Lynch syndrome, also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, is a common genetic disease. The predisposition of patients with Lynch syndrome to urological cancer, particularly upper tract urothelial carcinoma, is underappreciated. Urologists may be involved in several aspects of care involving Lynch syndrome, including identifying undiagnosed patients, surveillance of those with established Lynch syndrome or screening family members, in addition to treating patients with Lynch syndrome in whom upper tract urothelial carcinoma develops. We sought to increase awareness in the urological community about Lynch syndrome and provide some guidance where little currently exists. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement we reviewed the available published literature and guidelines from 1998 to 2014 on Lynch syndrome and its association with upper tract urothelial carcinoma. Recommendations based on the literature and the consensus of expert opinion are provided. RESULTS: No randomized or prospective study has been done to evaluate Lynch syndrome in the setting of urological cancer. All data were based on retrospective studies. Lynch syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disease caused by germline mutations in 4 mismatch repair genes, leading to the accumulation of DNA errors in microsatellite regions. Upper tract urothelial carcinoma develops in up to 28% of patients with known Lynch syndrome. The diagnosis of Lynch syndrome is established by clinical criteria, tumor tissue testing and genetic evaluation. Urologists should suspect Lynch syndrome when a patient with upper tract urothelial carcinoma presents before age 60 years or meets the 3-2-1 rule. Screening patients with Lynch syndrome for upper tract urothelial carcinoma presents a particular challenge. While no ideal screening test exists, at a minimum routine urinalysis is recommended using the American Urological Association guideline of 3 or more red blood cells per high power field as a trigger for further assessment. Upper tract urothelial carcinoma associated with Lynch syndrome presents at a younger age than sporadic upper tract urothelial carcinoma. It shows a higher proportion of ureteral cancer with a female preponderance and a possible predisposition to bilaterality. CONCLUSIONS: Lynch syndrome is a common genetic disease that is an underappreciated cause of upper tract urothelial carcinoma and possibly other urological cancers. Optimal screening for upper tract urothelial carcinoma in this population is unclear. Further study is needed to identify the best screening test and interval of testing.

BACKGROUND: Turner syndrome is characterized by a great variability of clinical manifestations caused by a total or partial loss of X-chromosome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective, descriptive study of the diagnosis, course, and current status of patients with Turner syndrome followed up at our section over the past 40 years, based on review of medical records supplemented with a telephone survey. RESULTS: Forty-five female patients with a current mean age of 22.95years (range 2-38) and a mean age at diagnosis of 4.71 were included. Sixty-three percent of them showed a mosaic karyotype. Short stature was the most common reason for consultation (54%), with increased prenatal diagnosis in most recent cases. Seventy-two percent have been treated with growth hormone, together with oxandrolone in 26%. Final stature was short in 69% of patients. Gonadal failure was found in 66%; most of whom received replacement therapy. Three patients achieved pregnancy by oocyte donation. The 31 adult patients are mainly monitored by the endocrinology (37.5%) and/or gynecology (34.4%) departments. As regards psychosocial aspects, 22% required support during school, and 80% completed middle to high level education. Two patients died, one due to dissecting aortic aneurysm and the other one, who had multiple pathological conditions, from respiratory failure. CONCLUSIONS: Short stature is the main cause of diagnosis in patients with Turner syndrome; most cases show genetic mosaicism. The most common clinical manifestations include short stature and gonadal failure. Eighty percent of patients complete middle or high education.

Broadly, HNPCC may be dichotomized into conditions that demonstrate defective DNA MMR and microsatellite instability (MSI) vs those conditions that demonstrate intact DNA MMR. Conditions characterized by MMR deficient CRCs include Lynch syndrome (germline MMR mutation), Lynch-like syndrome (biallelic somatic MMR mutations), constitutional MMR deficiency syndrome (biallelic germline MMR mutations), and sporadic MSI CRC (somatic biallelic methylation of MLH1). HNPCC conditions with intact DNA MMR associated with familial CRC include polymerase proofreading associated polyposis and familial colorectal cancer type X.

STUDY DESIGN: The Utah Birth Defects Network was used to ascertain a cohort of girls between 1997 and 2011 with coarctation of the aorta. Livebirths with isolated coarctation of the aorta or transverse arch hypoplasia were included and patients with complex congenital heart disease not usually seen in Turner syndrome were excluded. RESULTS: Of 244 girls with coarctation of the aorta, 77 patients were excluded, leaving a cohort of 167 girls; 86 patients (51%) had chromosomal studies and 21 (12.6%) were diagnosed with Turner syndrome. All patients were diagnosed within the first 4 months of life and 5 (24%) were diagnosed prenatally. Fifteen patients (71%) had Turner syndrome-related findings in addition to coarctation of the aorta. Girls with mosaicism were less likely to have Turner syndrome-associated findings (3/6 mosaic girls compared with 12/17 girls with non-mosaic 45,X). Twelve girls (57%) diagnosed with Turner syndrome also had a bicommissural aortic valve.

The intima stiffened with age and was not different between WT and Fbn1(mgR/mgR) tissues, whereas the media layer of MFS aortas showed progressive structural and mechanical degradation with a modulus that was 50% softer than WT by 3.5  months of age. Similarly, MFS mice displayed progressive structural and mechanical deterioration of lung tissue, which was over 85% softer than WT by 3.5  months of age. Chronic treatment with the angiotensin type I receptor antagonist, losartan, attenuated the aorta and lung tissue degradation, resulting in structural and mechanical properties not significantly different from age-matched WT controls.

Case report and review. BACKGROUND: Marfan's Syndrome (MFS) is a disorder of connective tissue, mainly involving the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and ocular systems. The most severe problems include aortic root dilatation and dissection. Anesthetic management is vital for the improvement on perioperative morbidity. CASE REPORT: 61-year-old male with MFS, presenting mainly with pectus carinatum, scoliosis, ectopia lens, previous spontaneous pneumothorax and aortal aneurysm and dissection submitted to thoracoabdominal aortic prosthesis placement. Underwent routine laparoscopic cholecystectomy due to lithiasis. Important findings on preoperative examination were thoracolumbar kyphoscoliosis, metallic murmur on cardiac exam. Chest radiograph revealed Cobb angle of 70  . Echocardiogram showed evidence of aortic mechanical prosthesis with no deficits. DISCUSSION: Preoperative evaluation should focus on cardiopulmonary abnormalities. The anesthesiologist should be prepared for a potentially difficult intubation. Proper positioning and limb support prior to induction is crucial in order to avoid joint injuries. Consider antibiotic prophylaxis for subacute bacterial endocarditis. The patient should be carefully positioned to avoid joint injuries. Intraoperatively cardiovascular monitoring is mandatory: avoid maneuvers that can lead to tachycardia or hypertension, control airway pressure to prevent pneumothorax and maintain an adequate volemia to decrease chances of prolapse, especially if considering laparoscopic surgery. No single intraoperative anesthetic agent or technique has demonstrated superiority. Adequate postoperative pain management is vitally important to avoid the detrimental effects of hypertension and tachycardia.", "sourceid": "27343792", "denotations": [{"obj": "Disease:D008382", "span": {"begin": 100, "end": 117}}, {"obj": "Disease:D008382", "span": {"begin": 119, "end": 122}}, {"obj": "Disease:D002311", "span": {"begin": 267, "end": 289}}, {"obj": "Disease:D008382", "span": {"begin": 420, "end": 423}}, {"obj": "Disease:D066166", "span": {"begin": 448, "end": 464}}, {"obj": "Disease:D012600", "span": {"begin": 466, "end": 475}}, {"obj": "Disease:D007905", "span": {"begin": 477, "end": 489}}, {"obj": "Disease:D000783", "span": {"begin": 536, "end": 544}}, {"obj": "Disease:D020347", "span": {"begin": 673, "end": 682}}, {"obj": "Disease:D018376", "span": {"begin": 978, "end": 1007}}, {"obj": "Disease:D004697", "span": {"begin": 1234, "end": 1256}}, {"obj": "Disease:D013610", "span": {"begin": 1416, "end": 1427}}, {"obj": "Disease:D006973", "span": {"begin": 1431, "end": 1443}}, {"obj": "Disease:D010146", "span": {"begin": 1715, "end": 1719}}, {"obj": "Disease:D006973", "span": {"begin": 1788, "end": 1800}}, {"obj": "Disease:D013610", "span": {"begin": 1805, "end": 1816}}, {"obj": "Species:9606", "span": {"begin": 1262, "end": 1269}}], "sourcedb": "PubMed"}{"text": "Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Colorectal Version 1.2016, NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology.

Two hundred and forty-five participants (73% female, 89% non-Hispanic white, 90% North American) completed an online questionnaire assessing clinical features of Marfan syndrome, pain severity, pain-related disability, physical and mental health, depressive symptoms, pain catastrophizing, and insomnia. Eighty-nine percent of respondents reported having pain with 28% of individuals reporting pain as a presenting symptom of Marfan syndrome. Almost half of individuals reported that pain has spread from its initial site. Participants in our study reported poor physical and mental health functioning, moderate pain-related disability, and mild levels of depressive symptoms, sleep disturbances, and pain catastrophizing. Those who identified pain as an initial symptom of Marfan syndrome and those who reported that pain had spread from its initial site reported greater psychological burden compared with those without pain as an initial symptom or pain spreading. Physical health is the largest predictor of pain severity and pain-related disability. While pain catastrophizing and worse mental health functioning are significant correlates of pain severity and pain-related disability, respectively. Pain is a significant and persistent problem in Marfan syndrome and is associated with profound disability and psychological burden.

However, cryptic Y chromosome material is suggested to be a risk factor for gonadoblastoma in patients with Turner syndrome. Here, we aimed to estimate the frequency of cryptic Y chromosome material in patients with Turner syndrome and determine whether Y chromosome material increased the risk for development of gonadoblastoma. A total of 124 patients who were diagnosed with Turner syndrome by conventional cytogenetic techniques underwent additional molecular analysis to detect cryptic Y chromosome material. In addition, patients with Turner syndrome harboring Y chromosome cell lines had their ovaries removed prophylactically. Finally, we assessed the occurrence of gonadoblastoma in patients with Turner syndrome. Molecular analysis demonstrated that 10 patients had Y chromosome material among 118 patients without overt Y chromosome (8.5%). Six patients with overt Y chromosome and four patients with cryptic Y chromosome material underwent oophorectomy. Histopathological analysis revealed that the occurrence of gonadoblastoma in the total group was 2.4%, and gonadoblastoma occurred in one of six patients with an overt Y chromosome (16.7%) and 2 of 10 patients with cryptic Y chromosome material (20.0%).

Regular low-impact physical activity is generally allowed in patients with Marfan syndrome, a connective tissue disorder caused by heterozygous mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene. However, being above average in height encourages young adults with this syndrome to engage in high-intensity contact sports, which unfortunately increases the risk for aortic aneurysm and rupture, the leading cause of death in Marfan syndrome. In this study, we investigated the effects of voluntary (cage-wheel) or forced (treadmill) aerobic exercise at different intensities on aortic function and structure in a mouse model of Marfan syndrome. Four-week-old Marfan and wild-type mice were subjected to voluntary and forced exercise regimens or sedentary lifestyle for 5 mo. Thoracic aortic tissue was isolated and subjected to structural and functional studies. Our data showed that exercise improved aortic wall structure and function in Marfan mice and that the beneficial effect was biphasic, with an optimum at low intensity exercise (55-65% V  o<sub>2max</sub>) and tapering off at a higher intensity of exercise (85% V  o<sub>2max</sub>). The mechanism underlying the reduced elastin fragmentation in Marfan mice involved reduction of the expression of matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 within the aortic wall. These findings present the first evidence of potential beneficial effects of mild exercise on the structural integrity of the aortic wall in Marfan syndrome associated aneurysm.

Free thyroxine (FT4), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO-Ab) antibodies, anti-thyroglobulin (TG-Ab) antibodies, and karyotype were investigated.

The differential mitochondria proteins were identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and were further confirmed by Western blot, immunoelectron microscopy and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in A549 cells as well as lung adenocarcinoma tissues. RESULTS: A total of 41 differentially expressed protein spots were found in A549 mitochondria. Of them, 15 proteins were highly expressed and 26 proteins were lowly expressed in the mitochondria of A549 (by more than 1.5 times). Among the 15 more highly expressed proteins, AAA-TOB3 (by more than 3 times) was highly expressed in the mitochondria of A549 compared with the 16HBE, by LC-MS/MS identification. High electron density and clear circular colloidal gold-marked AAA-TOB3 particles were observed in the A549 cells via immunoelectron microscopy. Besides, AAA-TOB3 was confirmed to be elevated in lung adenocarcinoma by Western blot and IHC. Moreover, increased AAA-TOB3 correlated with lymph node metastasis and advanced stage of lung adenocarcinoma (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: AAA-TOB3 was highly expressed in lung adenocarcinoma, and the up-regulation of AAA-TOB3 correlated with lymph node metastasis and advanced stage of lung adenocarcinoma, which suggested that it could serve as a potential molecular marker for lung adenocarcinoma.", "sourceid": "28623644", "denotations": [{"obj": "Disease:C565230", "span": {"begin": 10, "end": 18}}, {"obj": "Disease:D014388", "span": {"begin": 35, "end": 56}}, {"obj": "Disease:D008175", "span": {"begin": 70, "end": 98}}, {"obj": "Disease:C538231", "span": {"begin": 202, "end": 221}}, {"obj": "Disease:C538231", "span": {"begin": 672, "end": 691}}, {"obj": "Disease:C565230", "span": {"begin": 975, "end": 983}}, {"obj": "Disease:C565230", "span": {"begin": 1172, "end": 1180}}, {"obj": "Disease:C565230", "span": {"begin": 1263, "end": 1271}}, {"obj": "Disease:C538231", "span": {"begin": 1304, "end": 1323}}, {"obj": "Disease:C565230", "span": {"begin": 1369, "end": 1377}}, {"obj": "Disease:D014388", "span": {"begin": 1394, "end": 1415}}, {"obj": "Disease:D008175", "span": {"begin": 1429, "end": 1457}}, {"obj": "Disease:C565230", "span": {"begin": 1481, "end": 1489}}, {"obj": "Disease:C538231", "span": {"begin": 1514, "end": 1533}}, {"obj": "Disease:C565230", "span": {"begin": 1560, "end": 1568}}, {"obj": "Disease:D014388", "span": {"begin": 1585, "end": 1606}}, {"obj": "Disease:D008175", "span": {"begin": 1620, "end": 1648}}, {"obj": "Disease:C538231", "span": {"begin": 1722, "end": 1741}}, {"obj": "Chemical:CHEBI:51135", "span": {"begin": 387, "end": 401}}, {"obj": "Species:9606", "span": {"begin": 196, "end": 201}}], "sourcedb": "PubMed"}{"text": "Analysis of PTPN22, ZFAT and MYO9B polymorphisms in Turner Syndrome and risk of autoimmune disease.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal carcinomas with high-frequency microsatellite instability (MSI-H) account for 15% of all colorectal cancers, including 12% of sporadic cases and 3% of cancers associated with Lynch syndrome (also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer syndrome, HNPCC). Lynch syndrome is an autosomal dominant hereditary cancer syndrome, caused by germline mutations in mismatch repair genes, including MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2. METHODS: Published articles from peer-reviewed journals were obtained from PubMed, Google Scholar and Clinicaltrials.gov . Based on the recent research data, we provide an update on the MSI testing, along with the evolving role of MSI in diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of colorectal cancers. RESULTS: Studies have led to significant advances in the molecular pathogenesis and clinicopathological characteristics of MSI-H colorectal cancers. Emerging evidence suggests that colorectal cancers with MSI-H show different outcome and treatment response from those with microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors. Therefore, MSI testing is essential not only in the genetic context, but it may also have important prognostic and predictive value of response to chemotherapy and immunotherapy.

BACKGROUND: Marfan syndrome is a genetic disease, presenting with dysfunction of connective tissues leading to lesions in the cardiovascular and skeletal muscle system. Within these symptoms, the most typical is weakness of the connective tissue in the aorta, manifesting as aortic dilatation (aneurysm). This could, in turn, become annuloaortic ectasia, or life-threatening dissection. As a result, life-saving and preventative cardiac surgical interventions are frequent among Marfan syndrome patients. Aortic aneurysm could turn into annuloaortic ectasia or life-threatening dissection, thus life-saving and preventive cardiac surgical interventions are frequent among patients with Marfan syndrome. We hypothesized that patients with Marfan syndrome have different level of anxiety, depression and satisfaction with life compared to that of the non-clinical patient population. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with Marfan syndrome were divided into 3 groups: those scheduled for prophylactic surgery, those needing acute surgery, and those without need for surgery (n  =  9, 19, 17, respectively). To examine the psychological features of the patients, Spielberger's anxiety (STAI) test, Beck's Depression questionnaire (BDI), the Berne Questionnaire of Subjective Well-being, and the Satisfaction with Life scale were applied. RESULTS: A significant difference was found in trait anxiety between healthy individuals and patients with Marfan syndrome after acute life-saving surgery (p  <  0.01). The mean score of Marfan syndrome patients was 48.56 (standard deviation (SD): 5.8) as compared to the STAI population mean score of 43.72 (SD: 8.53). No difference was found between groups on the BDI (p  >  0.1). Finally, a significant, medium size effect was found between patient groups on the Joy in Living scale (F (2.39)  =  3.51, p  =  0.040,   <sup>2</sup>  =  0.15).

As evidence suggests microRNA dysregulations are implicated in many cancer malignancies, it is important to consider the changes in miRNA-target associations among different lung cancer biological states.

Mutations in the RAF1 gene are associated with Noonan syndrome, with a high prevalence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). RAF1 mutations cluster in exons encoding the conserved region 2 (CR2), the kinase activation segment of the CR3 domain, and the C-terminus.

This amino acid change favors a RAF1 conformation that allows for enhanced RAF dimerization and increased intrinsic kinase activity.

Herein we report on four female Subjects who were found to carry novel intragenic deletions in HDAC8. In one case, the deletion was found in mosaic state and it was determined to be present in ~38% of blood lymphocytes and in nearly all cells of a buccal sample. All deletions, for which parental blood samples were available, were shown to have arisen de novo. X-chromosome inactivation studies demonstrated marked skewing, suggesting strong selection against the mutated HDAC8 allele. Based on an investigation of the deletion breakpoints, we hypothesize that microhomology-mediated replicative mechanisms may be implicated in the formation of some of these rearrangements. This study broadens the mutational spectrum of HDAC8, provides the first description of a causative HDAC8 somatic mutation and increases the knowledge on possible mutational mechanisms underlying copy number variations in HDAC8.

We demonstrate that NIPBL haploinsufficiency leads to upregulation of gene sets identified in functions related to nucleosome, chromatin assembly, RNA modification and downregulation of Wnt signaling, cholesterol biosynthesis and vesicular transport in iPSC and cardiomyocytes.

Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in the United States and the leading cause of mortality in cancer patients. Biomarkers predicting survival of patients with lung cancer have a profound effect on patient prognosis and treatment.

The objective of this study was to perform machine learning with data from The Cancer Genome Atlas of patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) to find survival-specific gene mutations that could be used as survival-predicting biomarkers. To identify survival-specific mutations according to various clinical factors, four feature selection methods (information gain, chi-squared test, minimum redundancy maximum relevance, and correlation) were used. Extracted survival-specific mutations of LUAD were applied individually or as a group for Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Mutations in MMRN2 and GMPPA were significantly associated with patient mortality while those in ZNF560 and SETX were associated with patient survival. Mutations in DNAJC2 and MMRN2 showed significant negative association with overall survival while mutations in ZNF560 showed significant positive association with overall survival. Mutations in MMRN2 showed significant negative association with disease-free survival while mutations in DRD3 and ZNF560 showed positive associated with disease-free survival. Mutations in DRD3, SETX, and ZNF560 showed significant positive association with survival in patients with LUAD while the opposite was true for mutations in DNAJC2, GMPPA, and MMRN2. These gene mutations were also found in other cohorts of LUAD, lung squamous cell carcinoma, and small cell lung cancer. In LUAD of Pan-Lung Cancer cohort, mutations in GMPPA, DNAJC2, and MMRN2 showed significant negative associations with survival of patients while mutations in DRD3 and SETX showed significant positive association with survival. In this study, machine learning was conducted to obtain information necessary to discover specific gene mutations associated with the survival of patients with LUAD.
